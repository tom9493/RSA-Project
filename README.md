This is a python script that's hard coded to print the values used in the RSA project. It uses a modular exponentiation function to encrypt and decrypt and an extended euclidian algorithm to find the secret value for d. There is also a regular gcd function to test if Euler's totient is relatively prime to e, 65537. All these functions are non-compository. It also has code to get values for p and q, but it is commented out.

Run using: python main.py
